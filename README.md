Working on a contained, single-state game that uses coordinates, randomized encounters, and item economy to simulate a text RPG. Working with React-Redux, installed bootstrap but opted not to utilize it.

Before implementing the backend, I'm experimenting with the potential frontend to see how I want the UI experience to feel. As long as I keep my actions and reducers clean, I should be able to connect the API once I set it up.

Early stages for this project.
